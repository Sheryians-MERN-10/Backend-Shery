Create an Express App

1. Create a form in homepage -> /
	form must include input:text(filename) and button with method post and action "/create"

2. make a post route of "/create" in "index.js"  
now create a folder name "upload" in public folder, 
and using path package send "path" of the .../upload/filename.ext to browser,

let filepath= path.join(__dirname, "..", "public", "upload", req.body.filename)
"abc/public/upload/index.html"

3. Use "fs" package to and create an empty file on the same path given above
 and send message to browser "file created!"

4. Edit the "/create" post route and instead of sending "file created!" redirect the route to "/" existing get route

res.redirect("/") // existing get route

6. Edit the "/" get route and read the directory "upload" with "path" and "fs" package and console.log(...) it in terminal

7. Re-edit again the  "/" get route and send the files(array) in render and with the help of forEach show the list of files in "index.ejs"

8. Make the list item clickable and redirect to /file/:filename get route 
make /file/:filename get route in "index.js"
where the route send the param "filename" to browser

9. in the get route /file/:filename write a code to delete the respective file coming in the params with the help of path and fs and redirect the app to / get route

10. instead of clicking on file make "X" icon to delete the file in index.ejs

11. Make file in index.ejs cickable
 it should redirect to /:filename get route, 
in the route we read the file data coming in req.params.filename with the help of fs and path and send it to the browser

12. edit /:filename and instead of send use render index.ejs with the read data
	in index.ejs create new form below 
	create textarea in it and show the file data 


13. edit the /create post route and instead of redirecting to / get route redirect to /:filename route i.e 
res.redirect(/${req.body.filename})

14. add a submit button in new form in "index.ejs" and action of /update/:filename of post route
    make the same route in "index.js", we will get the file name from req.params.filename
    the updated data will be get in req.body.filedata
    write the code to rewrite(writeFileSync) the file in the same path with fs and path
    at last redirect to /:filename get route
